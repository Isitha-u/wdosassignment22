            <!-- paragraph about first manufacture -->
            <p><br><br><br><br>In 1993, a brief introduction to a piece of "recycled paper" took us on a journey that began what was
then a completely new industry in the country. The paper was produced at the Pannala mill, one of only two recycled paper in the country.
Due to many problems, the plant personnel left and production stopped. Taking over the management of the factory, we created a whole new 
team and added new products and processes to the production cycle - making paper from rice crop waste, bananas and pineapples,
as well as waste paper and elephant dung.
