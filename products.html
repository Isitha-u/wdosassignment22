            <p>An eco-friendly product is a product that is less harmful for the environment than their regular counterparts. 
                If more people started buying eco-friendly products, pollution would not be so rampant, our plant would have a timeout to 
                breathe and regenerate, and our families and communities would be healthier in the long term. Plus, eco-friendly products are
                 not only great for the environment, they are also beneficial for the human health.</p>

                <!-- paragraph 2 -->
           <p>Organic products may seem more expensive, but in the long run they are actually more cost effective. Eco-friendly products are trending
            last much longer. These products are usually made from recycled materials and are durable and withstand most drops, bumps and bumps.
            dishwashers. Eco-friendly products may have a higher price tag, but because they last longer, they are an investment that will pay off.</p>
