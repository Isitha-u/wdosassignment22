                   <p><br><br><br>We have come to an era when we do not know life without innovation.
                    We were born in it, got used to it, and gradually our progress is the main reason why our home is slowly dying.
                    People have discovered everything they can, from cars and constructions to food, clothing and just about anything.
                    We used all the materials we could think of,
                    and we have exhausted mother nature.</p>

                    <p>At the moment, some people do not see the harm that we are doing to our planet, but life is gradually changing.
                        Major issue is Global warming due to chemicals poisoning the Earth.Fortunately,
                        there are still people who care enough to fix and improve things. People and organizations promote sustainable products
                         to try to contribute to the salvation of our one world.</p>

                    Pollution prevention reduces both financial (waste management and cleanup) and environmental costs (health problems and environmental
                     damage).Pollution prevention protects the environment by preserving and protecting natural resources while promoting economic growth through
                     more efficient production in industry and less waste management needs of households, businesses and communities.Consumers play a major 
                    role in creating pollution. By some estimates, household consumption is responsible for most
                     pollution of the air and water in the world, but knowing how you use water, what you throw in the trash,
                    how you drive and how you use energy in your home, there are a few simple steps you can take to prevent heavy pollution.While you may 
                    think of pollution as a global issue, reducing pollution from your household can bring more immediate benefits through
                    improving the environment in your area.</p>
